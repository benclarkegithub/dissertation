# Coarse-to-fine Perceptual Decomposition With Deep Generative Models

One of the fundamental research goals of artificial intelligence is knowledge representation and compression.
At the heart of this are deep generative models (DGMs), models which approximate highly complicated and intractable probability distributions.
However, training DGMs to organise latent variables hierarchically, variables which represent high-level information about the data, remains an open problem.
This project investigates three novel approaches to coarse to fine perceptual decomposition.

See `Experiments` for an example of how the architectures, methods, datasets, and evaluation suite interact.
